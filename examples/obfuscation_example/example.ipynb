The user's request doesn't mention anything about the database being private or needing a description, so I'll just use the query parameter.

I need to shift each letter back by one in the alphabet. For example, T becomes S, F becomes E, and so on. But wait, I need to check if there are any letters that wrap around from A to Z.

The original string after shifting is supposed to be part of a SQL query. The first part became \"SLEECT\" which is likely \"SELECT\" with a typo. Maybe the next part is \"FROM\" then a table name. Let me see. The original \"Vtsfesrts\" after shifting is \"U s r e d r q s r\". Hmm, maybe \"Users\"?
